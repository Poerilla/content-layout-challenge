# Content Layout Challenge

Style the `/content-layout` page (showing 3 responsive content elements) using flex-box / grid CSS. Maximum width of the entire content area on desktop should be 1200px. [View the video example.](https://www.loom.com/share/ff22e61d7e914976913985aa2390efbb)

### Breakpoints:
- **360px:** each content element is full-width and stacked one on top of the other, with each content element also being in a stacked view (author area above content area)
- **576px:** each content element is full-width and stacked one on top of the other, with each content element having author area on the left, content area on the right (with text left-aligned)
- **768px:** each content element is at most 50% of the page width, with each content element being in a stacked view
- **992px+:** each content element is at most 1/3 of the page width, with each content element being in a stacked view.
